# OpenSoku
An -open source- implementation of the fighting game Touhou Hisoutensoku 12.3, developed by Twilight Frontier.

## Getting started

Follow the instructions below to get a --working-- copy of this project up and running.
(Note: I'm only working on the linux build for the moment.)

### Prerequisites

1. You will need all the .dat files from both Touhou 10.5 (Scarlet Weather Rhapsody) and Touhou 12.3 (Hisoutensoku).
2. You will need SFML 2.0 (or above).

### Compiling

## Linux

1. In order to compile the project, you first cd in the src directory,
```
cd src
```
2. Afterwards, you simply run make.
```
make
```
This will build opensoku for linux.

## Windows
(coming soon?)
